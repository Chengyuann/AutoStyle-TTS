Secondly, she is empathetic and understanding, as shown in her attempts to explain John's feelings and circumstances to John himself. Thirdly, she is a bit of a goofball, as seen in her silly and exaggerated reactions to the situation, such as saying \"Oh, my Gosh\" multiple times. Lastly, she is a bit of a hopeless romantic, as evident in her enthusiasm for John's relationship with Kate and her desire to see them together.",
